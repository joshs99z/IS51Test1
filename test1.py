The program is trying to decide which payment option makes the most money. 
First option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The second option is 1 dollar a day
with it being doubled each day for 10 days. There will be two functions for the solve for the pay rates.
funciton1 will calculate the pay rate for the first option, function2 will calculate the pay rate for the second
option.

function1 will output 100 x 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times, each time doubling the amount and adding the amount to the total.


If the amounts are equal, we output to the user "Option1 and Option2 pay out the same"
if option1 is the best we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if option2 is the best we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
